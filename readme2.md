## Overview
This project addresses the mental health challenges faced by remote workers and seniors by providing a seamless, AI-powered solution integrated into smart homes. By analyzing the user's mood through facial recognition, the system automatically adjusts the home environment (lighting, music, social activity prompts) to provide emotional support in real-time.

## Key Features:
Facial Emotion Detection: Scans facial expressions to analyze mood in real-time.
Smart Home Integration: Automatically adjusts lighting, music, and temperature based on the user’s emotional state.
Proactive Support: Offers suggestions for social activities, relaxation techniques, and reminders to stay connected with loved ones.
Privacy & Security: Implements robust data security measures to protect user information and ensure responsible AI use.

### The Problem
Remote workers and seniors are increasingly facing loneliness, anxiety, and a lack of social interactions, which can lead to deteriorating mental health. Many of them lack effective tools to monitor and address their emotional well-being.

### Our Solution
We’ve built an AI Mood Analyzer that integrates with smart home devices to provide personalized, real-time support:

For remote workers: Helps reduce feelings of isolation by creating a more supportive home environment.
For seniors: Promotes social engagement by providing gentle reminders and mood-enhancing adjustments in the home.

# Project Breakdown
## Empathize Phase
To better understand our users, we created two personas:

Sarah (Remote Worker): A young professional who feels anxious and isolated due to working alone from home.
James (Senior): A retired senior who misses social connections and often feels lonely and disconnected.
## Define Phase
We identified the core problem: mental health struggles due to loneliness and lack of social connections. Through our problem tree, we mapped out the causes (e.g., remote work, aging, lack of mental health resources) and the effects (e.g., anxiety, depression, isolation).

## Ideate Phase
Using the Walt Disney Method, we developed the following concepts:

Smart Home Emotional Assistant: Automatically adjusts home environments (lighting, music) to match the user’s emotional needs.
Interactive Mood Tracker: A wearable device that tracks the user's mood and suggests social activities or relaxation techniques.

## Business Model
We’ve outlined a business model that includes:

Key Partners: AI developers, smart home device manufacturers, and mental health organizations.
Revenue Streams: A subscription-based model for premium features and partnerships with mental health organizations for integrated services.
Customer Segments: Remote workers and seniors looking for support in managing their mental health.

### How It Works
Facial Recognition: The system captures and analyzes the user's mood through a camera or connected device.

Smart Home Response: Based on the mood detected, the AI adjusts smart home devices like lights, music, and temperature to create a calming or energizing atmosphere.

Social Prompts: The system suggests social activities, provides gentle reminders to connect with loved ones, or promotes relaxation techniques.

## Technologies Used
Database + Raspberry Pi with an Camera

AI and Facial Recognition: Detects and processes users' emotional states.

Smart Home APIs: Integrates with devices like Philips Hue, smart speakers, and temperature control systems.
