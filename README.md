![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd04cebf-0038-4c50-8ca4-93916dc90a54)

## Overview
This project addresses the mental health challenges faced by everyone who experiences loneliness and anxiety by providing a seamless, AI-powered solution integrated into smart homes. By analyzing the user's mood through facial recognition, the system automatically adjusts the home environment (lighting, music, social activity prompts) to provide emotional support in real-time.

## Key Features:
Facial Emotion Detection: Scans facial expressions to analyze mood in real-time.
Smart Home Integration: Automatically adjusts lighting, music, and temperature based on the user’s emotional state.
Proactive Support: Offers suggestions for social activities, relaxation techniques, and reminders to stay connected with loved ones.

### Future Plans:
Privacy & Security: Implement a robust data security measures to protect user information and ensure responsible AI use.
Smart Home APIs: Integrates with devices like Philips Hue, smart speakers, and temperature control systems.

### The Problem
Many individuals, particularly remote workers and seniors are increasingly facing loneliness, anxiety, and a lack of social interactions, which can lead to deteriorating mental health. Many of them lack effective tools to monitor and address their emotional well-being.

### Our Solution
We’ve built  an advanced AI system that scans faces to analyze mood and automatically triggers supportive actions, such as:
Adjusting lighting for a calming atmosphere
Playing soothing music
Suggesting social activities or connections

### Innovation
Seamless Automation
This innovative system operates automatically, responding in real-time to users' emotional states, ensuring proactive support for mental well-being without requiring manual input.

To better understand our users, we created two personas:
Sarah (Remote Worker): A young professional who feels anxious and isolated due to working alone from home.

James (Senior): A retired senior who misses social connections and often feels lonely and disconnected.

## AEIOU Observation Method
### Activities
Remote Workers: Engaging in extended hours of work from home, often with limited breaks.
Social Media Use: Spending time on platforms like Instagram or Facebook, sometimes deepening loneliness.
Distraction Activities: Using TV, gaming, or similar activities to escape feelings of loneliness.

### Environments
Home Setup: Makeshift home offices with little social interaction.
Living Spaces: Areas used for work, relaxation, and socialization often overlap, contributing to feelings of isolation.

### Interactions
Social Media Engagement: Engaging briefly via likes and comments, which lack meaningful depth.
Work Routine: Structured schedules, mostly revolving around screen time with little variation.

### Objects
Technology: Laptops, smartphones, and home office equipment heavily used for work and social engagement.
Home Office Tools: Basic setups often lack ergonomic design, causing discomfort.

### Users
Young Professionals: Struggling with work-life balance, often feeling isolated.
Older Adults: Seniors living alone with few social interactions, exacerbating loneliness.

## Define Phase
We identified the core problem: mental health struggles due to loneliness and lack of social connections. Through our problem tree, we mapped out the causes (e.g., remote work, aging, lack of mental health resources) and the effects (e.g., anxiety, depression, isolation).

## Problem Tree
![Problem Tree Template (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88929dac-4fb4-4446-9af6-21eb7959116c)


## Point of View (POV) Statement
### Persona 1 - Sarah
Who: Sarah, a young remote worker struggling with isolation and stress.
Need: A way to recognize when she feels overwhelmed and lonely to proactively manage her well-being.
Insight: Despite being connected digitally, Sarah feels emotionally disconnected, leading to unnoticed stress.

### Persona 2 - James
Who: James, a retired senior who struggles to stay connected with family.
Need: An intuitive way to understand his emotional state and feel more connected.
Insight: Technology could help, but James finds it too complicated, leaving him feeling isolated.

## Ideate Phase
Using the Walt Disney Method, we developed the following concepts:

Smart Home Emotional Assistant: Automatically adjusts home environments (lighting, music) to match the user’s emotional needs.
Interactive Mood Tracker: A wearable device that tracks the user's mood and suggests social activities or relaxation techniques.
