# Our Persona: 
Persona 1: Sarah represents a tech-savvy, creative remote worker facing emotional challenges like loneliness and burnout. Her struggles with work-life balance and the lack of deep social connections are very different from those of Persona 2: James, who is older and less familiar with technology, but both share a need for deeper emotional fulfillment.

Persona 2: James - 68 represents an older, less tech-savvy individual who experiences loneliness and isolation but has different needs and challenges than a younger user like Persona 1 (Sarah).
